Avansel Viewer is a Free Opensource ThreeJS based JavaScript library that let you view 360Â° panoramas and create virtual tours from them.

There are some commercial solutions in the market but yet no opensource solution that would be flexable, extandable, and supported. We want to have a JavaScript Panorama/Virtual Tour viewer that:

* Based on widely known JavaScript 3D library
* Easy to use
* Free to use in any project
* Support of third-party plugins and modules
* Support multiresolution
* Support hotspots, polygons, etc

You can find the source code for Avansel at [GitHub](https://github.com/avansel/viewer)
